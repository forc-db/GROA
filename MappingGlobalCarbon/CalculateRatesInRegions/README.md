## Calculate Average Carbon Sequestration Rate and Other Statistics in Areas of Interest

This folder contains code to calculate the average carbon sequestration rate and other statistics in areas of interest. Other statistics include the lower and upper confidence interval bounds for the average rate in a region, the variance in modeled rates over the region, and the minimum and maximum observed rate in the region.

Contents:
1. CalculateRateStatisticsInRegion.ipynb: Jupyter notebook using [Google Earth Engine's Python API](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install) to calculate rate statistics in ecozones by country and continent.
2. SreamlitApp-CarbonRate-GriscomAreas: Python code for a locally deployable [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) based web-app that allows users to calculate carbon sequestration rate and accumulation statistics for inputted regions.
