## Calculate Carbon Sequestration Rate and Other Statistics in Areas of Interest over [Griscom et al. 2017](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1710465114) Potential Restoration Areas
This folder contains code for locally deploying a Python based [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) app for calculating the average carbon sequestration rate and total accumulation for an inputted area of interest over potential restoration areas defined in [Griscom et al. 2017](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1710465114).

To deploy the app, install required models by running
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required modules
2. `streamlit run carbon-app.py` to run the streamlit app
