# Global Reforestation Opportunity Assessment (GROA)

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3983644.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3983644)

These data were assembled by the Nature Conservancy and a team of scientists from 19 institutions to quantify carbon sequestration in naturally regenerating forests around the world. This analysis was published in *Nature* in 2020 (Cook-Patton et al. 2020). 

We encourage the research community to collaborate in updating, correcting, expanding, and utilizing this database through the GitHub platform. 

### Relationship to ForC
GROA identified relevant studies within the Global Forest Carbon database, [ForC](https://forc-db.github.io/), and tracked down the original studies to confirm or update the data. It is now hosted by the [ForC-db organization on GitHub](https://github.com/forc-db). This repository also contains [code and data files for integration of GROA into ForC](https://github.com/forc-db/GROA/tree/master/GROA-ForC_integration).

## Data Use Policy and Guidelines

### License

GROA is licensed under [CC-BY-4](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), as described in [`license.txt`](https://github.com/forc-db/GROA/blob/master/license.txt).

### Communication/ collaboration with GROA team

While not required, we encourage researchers planning to use GROA to contact the principal investigator (Dr. Susan Cook-Patton, The Nature Conservancy) to inform her of intended use of the data and to discuss potential collaboration. 

### Database citation
Any publications using these data should cite Cook-Patton et al. 2020. 

In addition, this database should be referenced as well (DOI representing all versions: [10.5281/zenodo.3983644](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3983644)). If the data has changed since original publication, arising publications should cite the specific version used, ideally with a DOI associated with that version. Authors may contact Susan Cook-Patton (The Nature Conservancy) or Kristina Anderson-Teixeira (Smithsonian) to generate a release and associated DOI that matches the database version used.
